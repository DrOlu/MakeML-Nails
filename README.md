[MakeML](https://makeml.app?utm=github_nails_segmentation) is a Developer Tool for Creating Object Detection and Segmentation Neural Networks without a Line of Code. It's built to make the training process easy to setup. It is designed to handle data sets, training configurations, markup and training processes â€” all in one place.

## MakeML Nails
Is an app example that shows how users can try on different nail polish colors. The machine learning model was trained for 3 hours with 50 photos.

## Using another .tflite model

For using MakeML Nails project with another .tflite file, add it to the project and change this line with your name of the model.
```
NSString *modelPath = FilePathForResourceName(@"result_model", @"tflite");
```

Change the number of classes and add colors to the array:
```
int class_count = 2;
unsigned int colors[class_count] = {  0000000000, additionalColor };
```
