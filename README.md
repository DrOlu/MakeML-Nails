[MakeML](https://makeml.app?utm=github_nails_segmentation) is a Developer Tool for Creating Object Detection and Segmentation Neural Networks without a Line of Code. It's built to make the training process easy to setup. It is designed to handle data sets, training configurations, markup and training processes â€” all in one place.

## Train Objects Segmentation .tflite model

See the [Tutorial](https://makeml.app/docs/nails_tutorial_intro?utm=github_nails_segmentation) for the training object segmentation model without a line of code in macOS desktop application.

## Using another .tflite model

For using MakeML Nails project with another .tflite file, add it to the project and change this line with your name of the model.
```
NSString *modelPath = FilePathForResourceName(@"result_model", @"tflite");
```

Change the number of classes:
```
int class_count = 2;
unsigned int colors[class_count] = {  0000000000, additionalColor };
```
